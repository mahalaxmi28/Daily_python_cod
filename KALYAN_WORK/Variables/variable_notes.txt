Variables: A variable is just a name that stores some value in memory.


Example: 
x = 10      # x is storing an integer
name = "Kalyan"  # name is storing a string
pi = 3.14   # pi is storing a float


Rules for Variables in Python


Rule 1: Names can have letters, numbers, and underscores
example: my_name, age1, total_price   #these are valid in python
        1age, my-name, class  #not valid in python

Rule 2: Age = 20
        age = 30  # Case sensitive (both are different variables)
