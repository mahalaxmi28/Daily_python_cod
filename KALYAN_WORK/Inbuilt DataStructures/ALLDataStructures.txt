In built Data Structures in python

1.List
-> list is ordered and mutable collection.
->It can hold different datatypes(int,string,float,boolean)
->Allows duplicate values.

2.Tuple
->Tuple is ordered and immutable collectiuon.
->once created value cannot be changed

# empty tuple
t1 = ()

# tuple of numbers
t2 = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# tuple of strings
t3 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# mixed data types
t4 = (1, "hello", 3.5, True)

# single element tuple (comma is important!)
t5 = (5,)  


Tuple Packing:
When you assign multiple values to a single variable, Python automatically packs them into a tuple.

Tuple Unpacking:
Unpacking is the reverse process — you extract the values of a tuple into individual variables.



3.Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key–value pairs.

Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, tuples).

Values can be anything: numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, etc.

Dictionaries are mutable → you can change, add, or remove items.


4.Sets 
-> set is unordered collection of unique elements
-> set is mutable but elemnts inside the set are immutable
